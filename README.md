# GrowthRates
C implementation of the codes described in "Challenges and pitfalls of inferring microbial growth rates from lab cultures", by Ana-Hermina Ghenu, Loïc Marrec and Claudia Bank.

Briefly, we perform stochastic simulations of population dynamics using different growth patterns (Baranyi, Gompertz, Logistic and Richards).
